# Age Detection using Facial Images
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:
The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo
The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age

## Framework Steps
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to get an overall impression of the dataset.
2. Modelling with TensorFlow's ResNet50
3. Train and evaluate the model (On a GPU platform).


## Conclusion
* Based on the initial EDA of the dataset and the model, we managed to achieve a MAE of only 6.9541.
* The value of loss continued to decrease with each opoch untill it reached only 87.2.
